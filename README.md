            HTML

                I stumbled an article (by chance) about the importance of the meta tag in an html file.
                Apparently, using meta keywords would help in Search Engine Optimization. XD

            CSS
            <p>
                I learned to use css variables for recurring values like width and height which is being used by many classes.

                <strong>Factory Pattern</strong> : should be used when a lot of objects will be made out of it. Example from this exercise is the `Player` object, with the `createPlayer` factory.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Module</strong> : should be used when it makes more sense to only have one object of that type. Example from this exercise is the `GameBoard` object.

            Minimax Algorithm In Artificial Intelligence
        </li>
            <p>
              I heard about minimax algorithm when I was still in college, but have not really internalized what it really meant.  Minimax algorithm is a backtracking algorithm which finds an optimal move for the maximizing player by traversing the game tree. The depth of the traversal can be set. Basically, minimax works by creating the game tree with the assumption that the opponent player will be playing optimally. Each node in the tree represents a board state. Each node, except for the leaf, will have children, which can be derived as the possible next moves from that board node. Each state will have a score and the board node with the best score will be chosen to continue the traversal. There are other versions of the the algorithm like alpha-beta pruning which can be used to minimize the options. Some related terms that I learned about the algorithm are the following: </p>
             <ul>
                 <li><strong>Maximizing player</strong> : The player that the AI is finding the best move for</li>
                 <li><strong>Minimizing player</strong>: The opponent. It is assumed that the player will play optimally. The AI uses this assumption to look for the best moves. </li></ul>
