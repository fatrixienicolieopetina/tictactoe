            HTML
            <p>
                I stumbled an article (by chance) about the importance of the meta tag in an html file.
                For example, using the meta keywords would help in Search Engine Optimization. XD

        <li>
            CSS
            <p>
                I learned to use css variables for recurring values like width and height which is being used by many classes.

            Javascript
            <p>
                <strong>Factory Pattern</strong> : should be used when a lot of objects will be made out of it. Example from this exercise is the Player object, with the createPlayer factory.

            <p>
                <strong>Module</strong> : should be used when it makes sense to have only one object of that type. Example from this exercise is the GameBoard object
